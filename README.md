# Predicted_vs_Actual_Price_Move

The chart generated by the code visually represents data I gathered during the week of 01/29/2018. ThinkorSwim has a 'Market Maker Move (MMM)' calculation that aims to predict expected move. I was curious how accurate this prediction would be, and how many moves it would actually encapsulate. This was recorded at close pre-earnings along with actual moves by each security post earnings reporting. Additionally, IV and IV percentile was recorded pre and post earnings.
The chart displays the ratio of Actual move to Predicted (MMM) move with the IV percentile crush displayed in the background. The shaded green area between positive and negative one is the area within which the ToS MMM encapsulates. Any data point outside of the shaded area indicates a move outside of the expected move.
It was definitely not a normal week, but I was interested to see that the Actual : Predicted ratios were pretty evenly distributed about zero. There also wasn't a bias to the low side, even with the huge market decline we saw.
